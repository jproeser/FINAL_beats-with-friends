My project is Local Beats, a website that helps users connect with their local SoundCloud community.

The project utilizes the API's of Soundcloud, Google Maps and Pyzipcode to allow users to find other SoundCloud accounts based on a zip code and search radius. 

In order to run it, simply run the server through your terminal and then visit http://localhost:5000. From there you can go ahead and type in a zip code and search radius and view the results based on the users in that area.

You can also add users to the database by clicking the "Add SC User" button and adding their URL and Zipcode.
